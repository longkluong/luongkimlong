# Introduction to python

## What is Python

Python is a **high-level**, interpreted, and dynamically typed programming language that was first released in 1991. It was created by Guido van Rossum with the aim of making it easy to read and write, with a focus on code readability.

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
<=> \frac{\sum_2^3{2}}{5} = 8
$$

## Brief History

Python was created in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Guido van Rossum. It was first released to the public in 1991. Over the years, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages due to its simplicity, versatility, and large community of developers. It is now used in a wide range of fields, from web development to scientific computing to data analysis.

## Advantages of Python

- Python is a high-level programming language, which means that it is easy to read and write, and focuses on code readability.
- It is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable before you use it. This makes it easier to write code quickly, as you don't need to worry about data types.
- Python has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a wealth of libraries and tools available for almost any task you can think of.
- It is a versatile language that can be used for many different purposes, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.

## Installation and setup:

Python can be downloaded and installed from the official website (https://www.python.org/). There are two main versions of Python currently in use: Python 2 and Python 3. It is recommended to use Python 3, as support for Python 2 is ending in 2020.

After installation, you can use the Python interpreter to run Python code directly from the command line. Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Anaconda to write and run Python code in a more user-friendly environment.

# Python Code 

## Basic Python code 

### A simple print statement:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Basic mathematical operations:
```python {numberLines}
# Addition
- print(2 + 3)
+ print(5 + 3)

# Subtraction
print(5 - 2)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 4)

# Division
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)
```
## Variables and Data Structures

### Declaring and using variables:

```python
# Declaring a variable
name = "John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name John Doe Long Name "

# Printing a variable
print(name)
```
### Lists:

```python
# Declaring a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Indexing a list
print(fruits[1])

# Slicing a list
print(fruits[1:3])

# Modifying a list
fruits[1] = "mango"
print(fruits)
```
### Dictionaries:

```python
# Declaring a dictionary
person = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Accessing a value from a dictionary
print(person["name"])

# Modifying a value in a dictionary
person["age"] = 31
print(person)
```
## Control Structures

### Conditional statements:

```python
# If statement
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")

# If-else statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

# If-elif-else statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```
### Loops:

```python
# For loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# While loop
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```
### Functions:

```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Function call
greet("John")
```
## Data Analysis and Visualization
### Loading and cleaning data with Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Print the first 5 rows
print(df.head())

# Drop missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Print the shape of the data
print(df.shape)
```
### Basic statistics and aggregations with Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

#
```
